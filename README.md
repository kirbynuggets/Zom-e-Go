# Zomigo 🍴  

This is a **Zomato-inspired food delivery application** that I am building to showcase my full-stack development skills. Currently, the project includes a responsive front-end, and I am actively working on developing the back-end functionality.  

## Features (Current & Planned) 🚀  

### Current:  
- **Responsive Frontend**: Fully functional static front-end for exploring restaurants and menus.  

### In Progress:  
- **User Authentication**: User registration and login functionality.  
- **Restaurant Listings**: Dynamic restaurant data integrated with a database.  
- **Cart & Orders**: Adding items to the cart and placing orders.  
- **Payment Simulation**: Basic payment gateway simulation.  

## Tech Stack 💻  

### Frontend:  
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**  

### Backend (In Progress):  
- **Django** (Framework)  
- **SQLite3** (Database)
